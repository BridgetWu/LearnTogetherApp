I am doing my homework.
I am eating a big breakfast of toast and fruit.
He is leaving work.
The boy is growing up.
We are investigating a crime.
The baby is sleeping.
The dog is chasing a ball in the yard.
Mom is cooking soup for dinner tonight.
The birds are singing happily in the trees.
Dad is telling a bedtime story to me.
The flowers are blooming in the garden.
The rain is falling softly outside the window.
