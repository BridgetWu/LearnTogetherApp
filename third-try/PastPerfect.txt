The dad had bought his son a soccer as a gift.
I had studied for a whole week.
We had driven to the beach during summer vacation.
It had rained on Saturday.
The family had gone shopping for Christmas.
She had played with her toy car using a remote.
The students had already left the classroom.
I had already eaten half of my popcorn when the movie started.
We had already packed our suitcases before our vacation.
The sun had already set.
