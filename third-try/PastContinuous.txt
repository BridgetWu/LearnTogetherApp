It was snowing yesterday.
The boy was sleeping last night.
The girl was reading for the past hour.
He was driving down the road.
She was scuba diving under the sea.
My brother was playing video games using a controller.
She was riding her bike in the park yesterday.
They were building a sandcastle at the beach all afternoon.
We were roasting marshmallows over the fire.
My cat was lying beside me while I read.
